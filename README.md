# Analyzing-Hacker-News-Posts

### Introduction
Our aim is to analyze Hacker News (HN) posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.
- Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
- Users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting

We want to know:
- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?


### Given: Data Set
Data from the Hacker News and the dataset's documentation are found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).
